      <h1> Top 8 Dad Apps Available Now on Android Play Store </h1> 
      <h5>All the apps you need to be a great dad in the 21st Century!</br></br> May 15, 2020</h5>

      <p> After searching the Play store for contraction counting apps, I stumbled upon a few apps focused on dads. Despite all of the anecdotes and information about the birth, or general parenting tips we’ve received from friends and relatives, I noticed that there wasn’t as much information about being a dad on offer. </p>
<p> This list is for all those dads out there who want great resources about parenting, tailored specifically for them! </p>
<p> After installing and using each one to test out their features, here is my list of the best apps available for dads out there at the moment. From general parenting advice through to networking with other dads, and reviews of products that make parenting easier, I’ve trawled the depths of the app store, so you don’t have to. Here’s my list of great dad apps! </p>

</figure>  
<p>I really like this app. It offers dads the opportunity to chat in app with other dads, find support and help, and search the knowledge centre for information such as articles and podcasts, on being a dad. I really like their School Age Dads section which contains articles on topics like talking about periods, encouraging reading and being more flexible about bed time. </p>
<p> The Dad AF Events section has live streamed on everything from Dad Yoga, Physical, Financial and Relational shifts in parenthood to Perinatal health. They have events lined up for next month and beyond which should be of interest. </p>
<p> The Hub of Hope section offers local support groups run by charities and organisations if you want to chat about parenting issues in a supportive environment. </p>
There’s also a section called free stuff where you can find some competitions and giveaways to win free things, like their monthly £50 Amazon gift card give away. You can also volunteer to test new products such as prototype car seats by Joie (one of their brand partners). For mums looking for an easy Father’s Day present, there’s even an online shop stocking Dad AF branded t-shirts and hoodies in a variety of designs.
<p>While the app feels quite new, and some sections are more developed, with more content, than others, it is promising. Maybe they just need more downloads to build their in-app community! </P>

</figure>  
<p>This is a tinder-style app for dads to meet other dads in their area to stave off the loneliness of the daily baby walk in the park. You make a small profile to describe yourself and tell the app your location. Next you find yourself swiping left and right on possible matches. You are flagged as a possible match depending on your hobbies and likes. You can choose up to five hobbies from an extensive list. It’s early days but hopefully someone else out there likes rugby, pubs, and the internet, and will reach out to be my first Dadapp friend! In addition to this, there is a feed which seems quite active. Topics dads have been posting about ranged from serious pleas for help about post-birth sex drive issues, to one dad repeatedly asking people if there were any Wolves fans out there. He still hasn’t had a response. Maybe nobody uses Dadapp in Wolverhampton? Lastly, the app’s authors post quite regularly on a variety of topics about tips and tricks to get baby to sleep, through to creating meaningful routines for little one. If you want to socialise with other dads, this is the app for you!

</figure>  
<p> If you’re a lumberjack you’ll love this one! It’s woodsman themed, helping dads-to-be of the more outdoorsy type, visualise the three trimesters of pregnancy in terms of being in The Woods, on The Mountain and at The Peak. </p>
<p> The illustrations are pleasingly cute and feature eagles and mountaintops galore. My favourite parts of the app are its useful tick lists for packing the hospital bag and preparing for the birth, so you don’t forget anything important. </p>
<p>Descriptions are personalised with the name of your partner in the text – that is if you spelt it correctly at the start- which I did not. I’m sure it would have sounded more serious if bits hadn’t read like this: “poo will be growing in size and weight to support your developing cub”, or “the name of the game is hormones, and poo is on the front line”. (I think the Coronavirus lockdown may have led me to lose my mind while I was testing this app. Please ensure you are more sensible, and don’t fool around with the personalised name thing! </P>
<p>Click on the log to enter a journal entry (see what they did there?) </p>
<p> The BEST bit of this app is the glossary in alphabetical order, which is also searchable. It lists every baffling term that you’re likely to run into along the way to birth and beyond, with a concise definition so you can get your head around it (sound like you understand when asked by the midwife). </p>

</figure>  
<p>I love this app. It tells you exactly where baby is at week-by-week in terms of their development: how far they can see, what they prefer to see and hear, and little activities you can do with them to help them develop. Babies grow and develop at such a rapid rate it’s sometimes hard to keep up. This app keeps me focused on the changing needs and likes of baby. The tips are really down to earth, and I find myself getting excited at the prospect of trying them out week by week. This one will stay on my phone for a long time to come.</p>

</figure>  
<p>It’s not all about the baby! You both need to be heard and understood at a time that is going to change your couple’s dynamic dramatically. This app is organised by lessons that you must complete to access the next. There is a lot of good information here about relationships from a variety of angles: biological and chemical, social, and psychological. It covers communication, how to label emotions, how to help someone else process their emotions and much more. There are short embedded YouTube videos in the lessons. Learning is tested with a few multiple-choice questions at the end of each lesson. It does feel a little like going back to school but the information is useful and the lessons valuable. </p>

</figure>  
<p> This app just works. It does what it says on the tin. It measures the time between the start of a contraction and the start of the next, so that you know when exactly you need to get your skates on and head to the hospital. It has clear visuals that are easy to read which is the most important thing at this trying time!

</figure>  
<p>While this isn’t exactly a “dad app”, it’s more of a general parenting app, we all know that dads are the ones who really enjoy being active and playing with their kids. This app offers development-specific activities and games you can do with your little one to help them get the most out of play time, and to help you bond with them. Oh, the memories! You can’t get the app lined up and ready until little one’s arrived as you have to input birthdate and name before you can use it. But don’t let this limit you. Once you have put the relevant information in though, there’s a wealth of activities you can explore as a family.

</figure>  
<p>This is more of a memoir than an app. Written by one dad who has really reflected on the role of the modern father. It’s mostly anecdotal, with occasional references to studies, but it reads nicely and made me think about the way I want to show up for my child. It’s more of a thinker than a bells and whistles app, but well-worth a read. </p>

  <h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p> All of the apps are very different, and each has its own merits. I really like the idea of being able to connect with real dads in my area on Dadapp. I also enjoyed the outdoorsy feel  of Daddy Up with its reassuring glossary to look up pregnancy terms. My favourite has to be Dad AF down to the wealth of information, products, opportunities to engage with other parents and experts alike. Although it is the most jam-packed full of resources, I will probably also keep Dadapp installed in case anyone wants to be dad mates in the future!

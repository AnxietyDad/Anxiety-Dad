      <h2> HOW TO BE A GREAT PARENT?</h2> 
      <h5>A Lesson from The School of Life</br></br> May 8, 2020</h5>

      <p>This came as a horrible surprise to me: you are, to a large extent, the result of your parents'(-if you're lucky) /parent's- (if you're not so lucky) input from birth. At least, a lot of you is. This became apparent when I read "How to Overcome Your Childhood" from The School of Life. I bought it because in my journey to work out what kind of parent I wanted to be, it was suggested, by a colleague, that I start with my childhood experience. Who knew so much could be affected in your adult life, by the occasional missed kiss good night from mum, or the sometimes overly pushy dad telling you he wouldn't love you if you did badly in school that term? </p>
<p> And yet, it seems so obvious that we are just that- the result of years of experiences, guided by the most important people in our lives at the time – Mum and or Dad. I cannot recommend the book enough if you are preparing, as we are, for parenthood. </p>
<p>As we approach the three weeks to go mark, my partner and I have found ourselves discussing what our parenting style would be, or even should be. Is there an optimum style? (I would imagine so, but that is a topic for another post.) during the course of many evenings chatting, we kept coming back to the same idea: that to succeed where our parents did not, we must identify where they went wrong, and this is where the aforementioned book comes in. </p>
<p> How to Overcome You Childhood is a short text consisting of an introduction that briefly outlines why it is just so difficult to remember our childhood at all, and then outlines specific types of behaviours parents typically might display and the resulting trauma for their children, which is calls your “emotional inheritance”. For example, if you were unlucky enough to be called dirty, or treated in a way that would make you think you were dirty, by your parent, the resultant emotional inheritance in adult life would be timidity or inhibitions around sex and a habit of people-pleasing. Another example, in the concisely ordered table of parental actions and their emotional inheritance is unreliable love from a parent, which results in an adult who displays avoidant behaviour, or detachment, or someone who is overly independent. </P>
<p>Equally important are the lack of certain behaviours that also lead to trauma. What becomes quickly apparent from reading this book, is that whatever they do, parents are doomed to mess up their offspring in one way or another. This fills me with an uneasy terror, as I’m going to have my own baby / tabula rasa in less than a month. </P>
<p> Fortunately, the rest of the book addresses each emotional inheritance in equal petite chapters, summarising what might have been going on in the parents’ minds at the time, and then goes on to reassure you that, in the hands of a skilled therapist, you will probably be OK in the end. This felt somewhat reassuring, but what if our child grows up to be unable to afford an expensive therapist? </p>
<p> While this book is short in length and clipped down to a mere few pages of description per emotionally inherited malady, it has been an excellent springboard from which to launch our investigation into how to be the best parent. It left me reassured that, despite having my own, very specific emotional inheritance to f**k me up, it is an ordinary one, shared by huge swathes of the adult population, and that if I don’t have one particular hang up, someone else probably does, and for that reason we are all lucky to be f****d up in our own unique combinations!</P>

      <p> OK so I’m kinda lucky. My partner is an intensive care nurse so she knows her stuff about general health and where to find information, which is great for heart attacks and titrating pain relief.
</p>
<p>However, a few years ago she told me about a gruelling shift on a neonatal ward where she got freaked because she didn’t know how to drive a baby – because that’s what midwives are for.
</p>
<p> But we didn’t need to worry because the antenatal classes would clear all of that up for us, right? Wrong! They got cancelled. Thanks Coronavirus!
</p>
<p>So, with a healthy respect for the NHS from her, and my Google skills, we set about planning our own antenatal class. And it turned out not to be too difficult. It was lonely though. We haven’t met any parents to be yet, so that sucked. Anyway, if you should ever find yourself antenatal classless at any point, or just want to get ahead and show the rest of the class up with your knowledge, here’s what we did.  Obviously neither of us is a trained pregnancy or birth specialist, so if you can go to antenatal class, definitely do so! But if there’s another pandemic on, at least you’ll have the bare bones!
</p>
<p>You just need two things…

<h2> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/"> <strong> 1. NHS Website </strong> </h2> </a>
<a <img src="NHS_Website.png" height="50%" width="50%">
<p>
I can’t believe how crystal clear this website is. It lists everything you want to know about pregnancy and birth, is well-organised, and searchable. This is a great place to find quick answers to questions that understandably pop up over the course of the pregnancy.

I’m not religious, but if I were, this would be my bible. It is very clearly laid out, making information easy to find. This latest edition is bang up to date with the correct information (some older editions give advice that is now outdated or just considered a bit wrong these days).
</p>
<p>It covers absolutely everything week by week that will happen to your body, your emotions and most importantly, your baby. It can accurately predict and answer all manner of questions and worries that happen during the changing seasons of mum-to-be’s body over the nine month rollercoaster ride of pregnancy. If you want to know what seasonable vegetable your baby is at any given week, look no further, it’s got you covered.
</p>
<p>There were innumerable occasions when we found ourselves with a new ache, pain or change in mum’s body during the nine months of pregnancy, which each brought on a fit of the worries. At first, we thought about dialling 111 or the GP. However, every time without fail, the book would have a clear explanation for the particular symptom that we were worrying about, and would even mention that it was a common worry for expectant mums at week X or Y. To us, this felt amazingly reassuring and was enough to stop us from clogging up the call handlers at 111.
</p>
<p> I also spent a long time reading the handy sections for fathers in grey, which are at regular intervals throughout the book. The information was relevant, and to the point, in keeping with the rest of the book’s calming yet factual tone.
</p>
<p> We think this book is so well put together that we would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is pregnant. Customers think so to- with a heady three and a half thousand four and a half star reviews on Amazon UK. 
</p>
<p> In fact, they do equally useful follow on books for babies in their first year, second year, and as toddlers (below).  </P>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p> 
While getting to an antenatal class offers the best experience and advice, as well as the opportunity to connect with other parents in waiting, the What to Expect Book is a fountain of knowledge. The layout is clear and easy to navigate, with clear pictures. Couple this with the NHS website and you should be prepared if we ever have to have another lockdown (hopefully never again- I feel like I’ve almost completed Netflix and would like to get out to see humans again soon.)

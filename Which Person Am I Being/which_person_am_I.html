So, anxiety is a bummer. It has caused me trouble performing when being observed teaching ever since I qualified in 2014, to a point where I have had to ask for another observation, even though, to the observer I did really well, and they didn’t even notice that I wasn’t fine. Then, after many years of feeling like crap about being observed, I realised that this was just my mind, my thinking, that was creating this inner dialogue of thoughts saying: “you’re bad, you don’t deserve to be successful in the classroom, you don’t deserve to be happy, nobody wants you to do well, and so on.” I would listen to these spiralling thoughts and give them credence. It became so bad and was a pattern I now recognise has been happening for most of my life. Sometimes I wouldn’t hear an individual thought or feeling but would find myself in a negative spiral of self-despair. The thoughts had become so established, so normal, that my mind just knew them like a script, and would turn them on like a light switch. Very suddenly. Plunging me in a dark shroud of self-loathing. 
<p/>
<p>
Then I realised that I was identifying with this victim person inside. I was choosing to wear the victim hat. I was also sure there was always something wrong- the patient hat. I was going around wearing these two hats, framing my thinking and my interactions with people through these two heavy hats of negativity. 
<p/>
<p>
This bittersweet revelation led me to think. If I know that I am being the victim, or being the patient, in any given situation, I must be able to choose to stop being that person. Just asking myself, “which person am I being right now?” is enough to make me realise that I’m thinking about things in victim mode. Or while I’m complaining that something is wrong to someone in the staffroom, pausing and asking myself, “Which person am I being? Am I the patient? Am I the victim?” 
<p/>
<p>
This simple question, often, can be enough to shake me free of the doom and gloom of habitually negative thinking. The victim and the patient are the easy ones to recognise for me and the character I most often find myself being in the daily scenes of my life. Other characters do exist, but haven’t yet been identified!

<p>
You might be identifying with the victim too: everything happens to me, I have no agency in my well-being, I do things and nobody cares or notices, I don’t deserve to be successful, I can’t do this or that task well enough because I’m a bad person etc. Am I being the victim? 
<p/>
<p>
Maybe you’re the patient: something’s wrong, there’s always something wrong, my heart hurts so I’m going to die, I just feel that things are not right, my friendships aren’t what they should be, there’s something that needs fixing. Am I being the victim?
<p/>
<p>
After working out which person I’m being, I usually feel good enough to reframe my thinking more positively and move on with my day. This is because I realised, through mindful practice, that you are not your thoughts. When you realise you are being the victim person today, you have the choice, to notice how you are thinking and feeling, stay with those thoughts and feelings for a moment, and then choose to think or speak in a more positive way from that moment. It is that silent space between realising you are having negative thoughts and reacting to them that creates the inner change from one moment to the next. You have the choice of how to respond to negative thoughts, or feelings of anger. You can stay with that tight chest feeling or that persistent negative thought for a few moments, recognising it for what it is, but that peaceful space between having the thought or feeling of tightness in the chest, and knowing that you don’t have to believe it, give it credence, or act upon it is so powerful. “I am not my thoughts”. They might be real to you, but they are not true. Yes, something can be real, but untrue!

<p>
In my mindfulness practice, I have started following the structure below to bring attention to which person I am being in a given moment, and doing a kind of about turn, away from that mode, to a more positive one.
<p/>
<ol>
<li> Take a few deep breaths and ground myself in the body.</li>
<li>Where are my thoughts? Which person am I being right now? Am I the victim? Am I the patient? </li>
<li>Go back into the body. What sensations am I noticing? Is there a tightness in my neck? Are my fists clenched? Is my heart pounding? </li>
<li>Just acknowledge that this is happening right now, and letting it be. This is how I am feeling right now. Not rejecting the feelings, because they are real for me- just not true. </li>
<li>Remind myself, I am not my thoughts. I am being the victim/patient. </li>
<li>Come back to the breath for a few moments. </li>
<li>Continue on with my day feeling a little brighter! </li>
</ol>

My thanks to Tara Brach, who has helped me to elucidate my thinking around negativity through her new book, Radical Compassion. Her wonderful talks are also on Spotify and are worth listening to.
